With decades of experience repairing jewelry, the one thing that can be concluded is that precious metal will fatigue or erode over time. "Erosion" takes place when precious metals rub against equal or harder surfaces. Constant contact with counter tops, stone, or even other jewelry will slowly wear away gold or platinum settings, weakening hinges, joints, prongs and clasps.<br><br>

"Metal fatigue" takes place when gold or platinum is stressed by constant knocking or bending. The easiest way to envision this is to imagine a coat hanger being bent back and forth several times until it breaks. The impact of hitting a ring on a doorknob, or the constant depression of your bracelets spring clasp or latch, slowly contributes to fatigue.<br><br>

Once metal fatigue or erosion occurs, latches, clasps, prongs and links are prone to breaking, and our jewelry experts will prescribe the recommended procedures necessary to repair such damaged items.<br><br>

The most common jewelry repairs are related to worn parts or prongs. In many cases a simple prong repair can avoid having to completely replace an engagement center stone, or the loss of additional sentimental materials. Another common service need is chain repair. The links that make up a gold chain are in constant motion, wearing against one another, and making it susceptible to breakage which could lead to the loss of your pendant. Chains, along with bracelets and pins, also have jewelry clasps, which are often lost or damaged over time and need repair or replacement.<br><br>

Repairing necklaces is not limited to the soldering of precious metals. Long before the use of chains and clasps existed, beads and baubles where strung around the neck from string or cord. Still in use today, most of our work on beaded necklaces relate to pearl restringing or the stringing of semi-precious stone beads.<br><br>

From routine ring repair and bracelet repair, to elaborate vintage jewelry restoration, our jewelers have the technical skills, experience, and equipment necessary to provide competent solutions.

One of the most rewarding challenges for a master jeweler is executing a difficult antique jewelry repair, or performing jewelry restoration on vintage period pieces. Our talented artisans remain students of the old world craftsmen who created the elite jewels in eras past. We are excited by the challenge that comes with restoring a piece from the Georgian, Victorian, Art Nouveau, Edwardian, Art Deco periods.<br><br>

Our passion for antique jewelry repair dates back to our original founders who started our company in 1980. They specialized in antique jewelry repair and restoration, working for prominent estate jewelers and auction houses. Still active, the founders continue to cultivate their passion for vintage jewelry right here in our shop.<br><br>

Even today, our artisans are regularly called upon to restore and repair precious antiquities. Since our jewelers and model makers still create specialty and handmade pieces using tools guided by hand our craftsmen are very familiar with the repair and maintenance of hand-made masterpieces of all types.<br><br>

Having a passion for vintage jewelry and regular exposure to so many heirloom pieces provides our team with a distinct advantage. The only way to restore antiquities to their original condition successfully is to know how they should look in the first place; and with hundreds of years of combined experience our jewelers usually do.<br><br>

After a century of wear, many of the details on your old rings or bracelets have likely eroded away. In many cases, if it is an item that has been passed on for generations, you may not even know what it originally looked like. At Jewelry Designs you can be almost certain that someone within our knowledgeable staff is familiar with its original style or pattern. They can advise you on the range of options possible to restore your ring, bracelet, necklace or brooch while maintaining as much provenance as possible.
